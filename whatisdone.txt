In this i am creating a todo app which  is an app that contains list of activities that i done and those i dont done.
first is creating the structure using react app.jsx by creating div and the required elements in the div.
    the we adding the use state hook and making the input displayed in the todolist items that the input we enter to be done
    will appear on the todo list items and there is now exists a problem that when the page is refreshed so the entered tasks deleted automatically so 
    we want to solve this

    we used map and spread for all this and usestates for title description and the button on clicking the button the function call occours and inside that
    the spread operator is used and map is used to display the input items on the todollist items


    step 2

    solving the problem of automatically deleting the contents after refreshing the pages.
    we need to store this to store a string or array we need to stringify it and store it in local storage(here global object JSOn used)

        syntax : localstorage.setItem('todolist',JSON.stringify(arrayname)); here store it as an array but there is also string so we need useeffect

        here useeffect hook is needed when the page is loaded useeffect check whether there is an item in the local storage or not.

        inside the useEffect we use JSON.parse to convets the string to an array. we need array here.

             let savedTodo=JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('todolist'));

             here we are giving a conditiion that the 
                nammal ivide null use akilla karanam if we use null map operation cannot be performedddd..
                so we used this 

                here conditon based on this

                if(savedTodo){
                    setAlltodo(savedTodo)  //nammal mandakate  pole change akuvannnn setAlltodo set akuvan but entelum ondel run akum illel onum ilala
                    //entelum ondel matram work akum allel remains as an empty array (we initialy set as usestate([]))    alltodonteeees                    
                }


            in the case of delting an element we use the splice onclick used  and taken index as parameter of the arrow function which invoked
            on clicking the deleted

            on that a variable it taken spread operator is used and the splice used remember also the parameter of the functionis also the index
           
            reducedTodo.splice(index,1);//sytax of the splice 1 specify that only one element is to be removed.
            update local storage and the setalltodo with the elments after remaining after the delete operation
